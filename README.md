### What I learned

I have done some frontend a long time ago, and back then I did not know much so for me this was a project to recap some of my own knowledge. I know ting can be made better and easier.

Somewere in te back of my head I felt like it would be best to organize the content of the card in an unordered list since all the information is linked together somehow.

```html
<div id="card">
  <ul id="carditems">
    <li>
      <img
        src="/images/image-qr-code.png"
        alt="QR-code link to frontendmentor.io"
        width=""
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
        next level
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

For styling the hardest part was to get the size of the card right and those bloody margins right. There is proabably a simpler way, but what I did was to put 39% margins on each side of the card to get the size I wanted.

```css
#card {
  margin: 10% 39%;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  box-shadow: 2px 4px 20px rgba(123, 135, 157, 0.3);
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 0;
  position: relative;
}
```

I didnt like the way the text on the card scaled and ruined the card itself, so I sized the text to 1.1vw instead of 15px.

Lastly I made the page more responsive to work on mobile devices.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 700px) {
  #card {
    margin: 10% 10%;
    font-size: 15px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to get better with css in general. More specifically I would like to get better at flexbox and get more controll on how margins and padding overlaps.

### Useful resources

- [CSS responsive text](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_text.asp) - W3 Schools helped me remembering how to write responsive pages.
- [Flexboxsheet](https://flexboxsheet.com/) - This is an amazing cheat sheet really helped me with flexbox and I really recommend it for anyone using flexbox.
